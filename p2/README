The testhw and the Testing directory are now available for use.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your BTree source code.
testhw will copy from the Testing directory those files that you were not suppose to change.
It will also copy a special Makefile, and some .dat files.
It then compiles your program, and runs 10 tests on it.  
The results are placed in the results.txt file in the directory with the source code in it.
